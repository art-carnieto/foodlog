This repository is for personal studies purposes and my first contact with the Rails framework.

I am following the [*Ruby On Rails Crash Course 2020*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Fbujmgo60), kindly made by Andy Leverenz from the channel [Web-Crunch](https://www.youtube.com/c/Webcrunch) and it is posted on the channel [Traverse Media](https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb) on YouTube. Please make sure to also check out his blog on [Web-Crunch.com](https://web-crunch.com/).
